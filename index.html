<article class="page__body">
  <p>I'm a 3rd-year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley based in the Bay Area studying Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences (EECS) interested in VLSI design, verification, formal verification, and validation of integrated circuits and/or systems-on-chip.</p>

  <p>This summer, I am working at Crossbar Inc., a semiconductor startup based in Santa Clara that specializes in a type of non-volatile memory (ReRAM), as an ASIC Engineering Intern. My work involves working with the Design team on integrating scalable, open-sourced RISC-V design and verification toolchains in the company's system-on-chip design flow.</p>

  <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy playing video games (LoL, Pokémon, indie games, and many more), jazz, going to the gym, and generally just hanging out with people.</p>

  <p>If you want to contact me, feel free to email me at ezw(AT)berkeley(DOT)edu. Thanks for reading :)</p>
