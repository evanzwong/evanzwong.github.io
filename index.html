  <p>Hi, I'm Evan! I'm a 3rd-year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley based in the Bay Area studying Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences (EECS) interested in VLSI design, verification, and formal verification of integrated circuits and/or systems-on-chip.</p>

  <p>I'm currently an Undergraduate Research Assistant advised by <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/pnuzzo.html">Professor Pierluigi Nuzzo</a> at the <a href="https://bwrc.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Wireless Research Center</a>, where my research involves designing a hardware Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver accelerator in C++. Specifically, the accelerator I'm working on aims to accelerate the Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP) algorithm.</p>

  <p>This upcoming summer (2026), I'll be working at <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> in Cupertino as a Pixel IP Design Intern in the Silicon Engineering Group on the Pixel Team.</p>

  <p>This past summer, I worked at <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/company/about-crossbar/">Crossbar Inc.</a>, a semiconductor startup based in Santa Clara that specializes in a type of non-volatile memory (ReRAM), as an ASIC Engineering Intern. My work involved working with the Design team on integrating scalable, open-sourced RISC-V design and verification toolchains using SpinalHDL in the company's system-on-chip design flow.</p>

  <p>Outside of career-oriented things, I enjoy playing video games (LoL, Pokémon, indie games, and many more), jazz, going to the gym, and generally just hanging out with people. Formerly a coach for the Cal Esports Division 2 League of Legends team at UC Berkeley, I currently serve as the Competitive Coordinator where I help form the teams semester-by-semester and support student Esports athletes as the department liaison.</p>

  <p>If you want to contact me, feel free to email me at ezw [at] berkeley [dot] edu. Thanks for reading :)</p>
