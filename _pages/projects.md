## Formal Specification of Branch Prediction Using CTL
Formulated process to apply Computation Tree Logic to model branch prediction in simple ISAs (this project used RV32I). Wrote RISC-V assembly tests to train custom branch predictors to mispredict into harmful architectural states. Interfaced custom configurations and tests with Spike simulator and emitted files for JasperGold formal checking.
