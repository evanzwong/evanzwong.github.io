Hi! I'm Evan, a 3rd-year undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley based in the Bay Area studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences (EECS) interested in VLSI design, verification, formal verification, and validation of integrated circuits and/or systems=on-chip.

This summer, I am working at Crossbar Inc., a semiconductor startup based in Santa Clara that specializes in a type of non-volatile memory (ReRAM), as an ASIC Engineering Intern. My work involves working with the Design team on integrating scalable, open-sourced RISC-V design and verification toolchains in the company's system-on-chip design flow.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing video games (LoL, Pokemon, indie games, and many more), jazz, going to the gym, and generally just hanging out with people.

If you want to contact me, feel free to email me -> ezw(AT@)berkeley(DOT.)edu. Thanks for reading :)
